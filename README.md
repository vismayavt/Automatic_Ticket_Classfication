#  Automatic Ticket Classification

This project focuses on automating the classification of support tickets using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning techniques. It helps streamline customer service operations by categorizing tickets based on their content.

---

##  Problem Statement

Manually classifying support tickets is time-consuming and error-prone. This project aims to automatically classify incoming tickets into predefined categories (e.g., Billing, Technical Issue, Account, etc.) to enable faster and more efficient resolution.

---

## Objectives

- Build a machine learning model to classify support tickets.
- Perform text preprocessing and feature engineering.
- Evaluate different classification algorithms (Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, etc.).
- Optimize the best model using hyperparameter tuning.
- Deploy the model as an API (optional).

##  Tech Stack

- Python
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas / NumPy
- NLTK / spaCy
- Jupyter Notebook

---

##  Workflow

1. Import and explore the dataset
2. Clean and preprocess text data
3. Vectorize using TF-IDF or CountVectorizer
4. Train and evaluate models
5. Output predictions
